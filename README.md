- Some optimizations require a system restart
- Backup your system before making changes
- For best results, close unnecessary applications
- Optimizations are specifically tailored for Fortnite
- **About Antivirus Detection:**
  - FortLatency Pro may trigger false positives in some antivirus software, including VirusTotal
  - This is common for optimization tools that modify system settings
  - You can verify the safety by:
    1. Checking the file's digital signature
    2. Scanning with reputable antivirus software
    3. Monitoring system changes made by the application
    4. Verifying the executable hash matches our official release
  - While we understand the concern about false positives, we prioritize user privacy and security, therefore the source code remains private
  - All modifications made by FortLatency are transparent and can be reversed using the "RESTORE" button
